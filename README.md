#### To run the code without code editing, make sure the following file directory structure:

```
├─dataset // MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, or you can change the root in source code
│  └─Your Datasets
├─workplace
│  └─Guard-against-Infringement-An-Anti-Distillation-Federated-Learning-Watermarking-Framework
```

#### then:
```
cd Guard-against-Infringement-An-Anti-Distillation-Federated-Learning-Watermarking-Framework
```

#### and finally:
```
python test_mnist.py    // or test_cifar.py
```

We apologize for any inconvenience caused while running the code. Until the article is officially published, we will continue to optimize the code to ensure its ease of operation and readability in the following editions.
